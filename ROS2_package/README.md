This repository is to introduce how to use Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) on Raspberry pi 4 installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server version. The main goal of this project is to build a new opensource mobile robot platform, called SMARTmBOT.
The SMARTmBOT is for studying multi-robot algorithms, so it has differential wheels, 8-ToF sensors, 2-line sensors, and a pi-camera.

We believe that you can easily develop the mobile robot platform if you carefully follow the tutorials. If you have issues and find errors, please let us know. We will update it as soon as possible.
